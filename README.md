# Customisation

If you need customised mandate references, exclude certain collection dates, or add a custom transaction message to the collection, you want to create a sepa customization extension implementing the following hooks:
* `civicrm_create_mandate` - to generate custom mandate reference numbers
* `civicrm_defer_collection_date` - to avoid days when your bank won't accept collections. (Version 1.2+ can skip weekends w/o this hook)
* `civicrm_modify_txmessage` - to customize the transaction message (Version 1.2+ can set a generic message w/o this hook)
* `civicrm_alter_next_collection_date` - alter the next collection date for a mandate.

We added an example implementation for your convenience: [org.project60.sepacustom](https://github.com/Project60/sepa_dd/tree/master/org.project60.sepacustom)
